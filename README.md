## Disclaimer
This repository is public for transparency and easy contributing, not to help you set up a selfhosted copy.
Our recommendation to use this bot is to just <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592760951103684618">use Ninigi</a> instead of selfhosting.  
If you want to make a new feature, create a PR! User installs existing further invalidates the need for selfhosting.  
You can reach out for questions and are welcome to try as long as you follow the license.
