## Data collected
User, channel and server IDs can be stored in our database to maintain specific userinfo, logging and guild command aspects respectively.  
None of this data can be manually searched through or fetched outside of that server or a server containing said user or channel.

## Data collection purposes
Data is exclusively collected to maintain features like leaderboards, logging etc. through restarts. No aggregation, advertising or other unauthorized usage or sharing of this data will take place.

## How long do you store it?
For the moment, user IDs are stored permanently. In the future we plan to clean up data of users who haven't interacted with the bot in a long time.

## I want to delete all my data
Either create an issue here or shoot the host of the bot instance a dm on Discord. You can see the bot host's tag by using `/botinfo`.
