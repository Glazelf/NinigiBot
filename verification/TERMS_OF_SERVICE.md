## Rights of usage
Using this bot is a privilege. If you purposefully interact in a low-quality way this privilege can be revoked.  
An example of a low quality interaction would be trying to inject slurs into leaderboards or trying to overload the bot's connection.

## Data storage
You agree to have non-personal data stored in our databases if you interact with the bot.  
The only data that is stored automatically without manually adding it to the bot is your user ID.

## Feedback
For feedback, both positive and negative, we recommend you start a [discussion](https://github.com/Glazelf/NinigiBot/discussions).
